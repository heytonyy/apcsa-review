Question 1: 
A) 3.0

Explanation: The division `a / b` is integer division (15 / 4 = 3), 
which is then implicitly cast to a double. The result is 3.0, not 3.75, 
because integer division truncates the decimal part.


Question 2: 
A) 1 2

Explanation: `x % y` is 7 % 3 = 1 (the remainder when 7 is divided by 3). 
`x / y` is 7 / 3 = 2 (integer division). So the output is "1 2".


Question 3: 
E) p = 5, q = 12, r = 16

Explanation: 
- Initially, p = 5.
- `++p` increments p to 6 before using its value, so p = 6.
- q = 6 * 2 = 12.
- For `p-- + q`, we use p = 6 first (then decrement), so r = 6 + 12 = 18.
- After the postfix decrement, p = 5.
- Final values: p = 5, q = 12, r = 18.


Question 4: 
A) 7

Explanation:
- 15.7 / 2.2 = 7.13636...
- Casting to int truncates the decimal part, resulting in 7.


Question 5: 
D) 2.857142...

Explanation:
- `a` is cast to a double before division, making this floating-point division.
- (double) 20 / 7 = 20.0 / 7 = 2.857142...
