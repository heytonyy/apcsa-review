Question 1:
Answer: D) 6

Explanation: The code sets each element to the product of its row and column indices. 
For arr[2][3], the calculation is 2 * 3 = 6.

Question 2:
Answer: C) 15

Explanation: This code calculates the sum of the main diagonal elements: 
grid[0][0] + grid[1][1] + grid[2][2] = 3 + 4 + 8 = 15.

Question 3:
Answer: B) 19

Explanation: The mystery method calculates the sum of elements below the main diagonal (where row index > column index). 
These elements are nums[1][0], nums[2][0], and nums[2][1], which are 4, 7, and 8. 
The sum is 4 + 7 + 8 = 19.

Question 4:
Answer: C) 18

Explanation: The code creates a matrix with:
- 1's on the main diagonal (3 elements: [0][0], [1][1], [2][2])
- 2's above the main diagonal (3 elements: [0][1], [0][2], [1][2])
- 3's below the main diagonal (3 elements: [1][0], [2][0], [2][1])

The sum is: (3 × 1) + (3 × 2) + (3 × 3) = 3 + 6 + 9 = 18.

Question 5:
Answer: B) Reflects the array across the main diagonal

Explanation: This method transposes the 2D array by swapping rows and columns. 
Each element at position [r][c] in the original array is placed at position [c][r] in the new array. 
This effectively reflects the array across its main diagonal.
