Question 1:
Answer: A) x = 8, y = 6

Explanation: Let's trace through the execution:
- Initially: x = 0, y = 10
- Iteration 1: x = 2, y = 9
- Iteration 2: x = 4, y = 8
- Iteration 3: x = 6, y = 7
- Iteration 4: x = 8, y = 6
- Check condition: is 8 < 6? No, so the loop terminates
- Final values: x = 8, y = 6

Question 2:
Answer: E) All of the above

Explanation: 
- Option A: Loop runs for i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (5 iterations)
- Option B: Loop runs for i = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (5 iterations)
- Option C: Loop runs for i = 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 (5 iterations)
- Option D: Loop runs for i = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (5 iterations)
- All options print exactly 5 asterisks

Question 3:
Answer: B) 1

Explanation: The code counts the occurrences of 'e' or 'o' in the string "computer". 
There is 1 'o' and 0 'e', so count = 1.

Question 4:
Answer: 
A) 1
1 2
1 2 3

Explanation: 
- First iteration of outer loop (i=1): inner loop runs once (j=1), prints "1"
- Second iteration of outer loop (i=2): inner loop runs twice (j=1,2), prints "1 2"
- Third iteration of outer loop (i=3): inner loop runs three times (j=1,2,3), prints "1 2 3"

Question 5:
Answer: C) "ADG"

Explanation: The loop starts with i = 0 and increments by 3 each time:
- i = 0: result += "A" => result = "A"
- i = 3: result += "D" => result = "AD"
- i = 6: result += "G" => result = "ADG"
- i = 9: 9 >= str.length() (9), so loop terminates
- Final result = "ADG"
