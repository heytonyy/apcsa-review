Question 1: 
C) puter s

Explanation: 
`substring(3, 9)` returns the characters from index 3 (inclusive) to index 9 (exclusive). 
In "computer science", these characters are "puter s".


Question 2:
C) s3 == s4

Explanation: String literals (like "Hello") are stored in a special memory area called the String pool. 
When two identical literals are used, Java reuses the same object. 
Therefore, s3 and s4 refer to the same object, making s3 == s4 true. 
However, using the new keyword creates distinct objects, 
so s1 == s2 is false (though s1.equals(s2) would be true).


Question 3:
B) 12.25

Explanation: `Math.abs(-3.5)` returns the absolute value of -3.5, which is 3.5. 
Then `Math.pow(3.5, 2)` computes 3.5Â², which equals 12.25.


Question 4:
Answer: A) AP

Explanation: `str.indexOf(" ")` finds the index of the first space, which is 2. 
Then `str.substring(0, 2)` extracts characters from index 0 up to (but not including) index 2, which gives "AP".


Question 5:
 A) null is null

Explanation: In Java, concatenating null with a string implicitly converts null to the string "null". So, s + " is null" becomes "null is null". Note that this does NOT throw a NullPointerException because no method is being called on s.
