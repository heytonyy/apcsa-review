Question 1:
Answer: B) 0 1

Explanation:
- c1 is incremented twice, so its count becomes 2
- c2 is incremented once, so its count becomes 1
- Counter.resetCounter(c1) resets c1's count to 0
- c2 is unaffected, so it remains 1
- The output is 0 1

Question 2:
Answer: C) 80

Explanation:
- The Rectangle is created with length 4 and width 5, so the initial area is 4 * 5 = 20
- resize(2) multiplies both length and width by 2, making them 8 and 10 respectively
- The new area is 8 * 10 = 80

Question 4:
Answer: B) 3.0 x 3.0 x 3.0 has volume 27.0

Question 5:
Answer: C) It is a static method that can access the private instance variables of Points.

Explanation:
- The distance method is static, as indicated by the static keyword
- It can directly access the private instance variables (x and y) of the Point objects passed to it
- This is allowed in Java because the method is in the same class as the private variables it's accessing
